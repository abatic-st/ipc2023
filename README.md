"Developing advanced Client/Server applications with Pascal". International Pascal Congress 2023


## [International Pascal Congress](https://pascalcongress.com/) 
### _July 3-7, 2023, Salamanca (Spain)_
The International Pascal Congress (IPC) is an international forum dedicated to bringing together the different players in the software industry whose technologies are based on the Pascal family of programming languages. 

The IPC 2023 will be held from 3 to 7 July 2023, hosted by the University of Salamanca in Spain, and it will be a stunning and forward-looking reflection on the Pascal family of languages in the software industry. 

The official language of the IPC 2023 will be english.





# Course "Developing advanced Client/Server applications with Pascal". International Pascal Congress 2023

**Title:** Developing advanced Client/Server applications with Pascal  
  
  
**Summary**: In this course we are going to see different technologies to be able to work in Client/Server mode. Communication between devices is something primordial in current application development, as a large number of programs require these features to be incorporated. Thus, this course can be very useful for all those who wish to be introduced to inter-application communication and those who want to update their knowledge on this subject. We will start with connection via TCP/IP Socket, an option widely used in different production environments. We will continue with REST API connections, and we will take a look at the different components available in Lazarus and Delphi. Finally, we will look at components that make use of the binary protocol MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) and the text protocol STOMP (Streaming Text Orientated Messaging Protocol).  

**Contents**:  
  
Session 1- SOCKET.  
  
● Sockets are the basis of communication between computers and are still widely used to send information between the different components of a network.  
  
Session 2- REST APIs.  
  
● REST APIs are widely used to share information between different systems and are currently widely used in web development where we have a web application that connects to a web server where it communicates through its REST API to obtain the necessary data from the application.  
  
Session 3- MQTT ( The Standard for IoT Messaging )  
  
● MQTT is a protocol that works according to the principles of the publication or subscription model. In this way we manage to decouple the sender of the message (publisher) from the receiver of the message (subscriber).... As you can see, it is very interesting to be able to create systems. MQTT has become the most popular communication model for IoT applications because it is a low-power protocol for these devices, requires low bandwidth and has the ability to implement QoS to prevent information loss. Companies such as Facebook make use of this protocol in their chats.  
  
Session 4 - STOMP (Simple (or Streaming) Text Oriented Messaging Protocol)  
  
● You may be familiar with applications that make use of this protocol such as Apache ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ (even kafka has a plugin for STOMP). STOMP is a simple text message transfer protocol, designed to work with message-oriented middleware.
